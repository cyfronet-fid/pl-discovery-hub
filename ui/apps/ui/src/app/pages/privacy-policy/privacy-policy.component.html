    <h1>Privacy Policy of EOSC.pl Platform</h1>

    <p><em>Last updated: July 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      The EOSC.pl Platform, available at
      <a href="https://eosc.pl/">https://eosc.pl/</a>
      (hereinafter referred to as "Site" or "Application") comprises two main functionalities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>one for users who browse and access research services and resources, and</li>
      <li>one for organisations and providers who register and onboard their services (e.g., computing services, repositories, training tools).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This Privacy Notice outlines how personal data is collected, used, and protected across both
      functionalities, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and related EU law.
    </p>

    <div class="principles">
      <strong>We follow these key principles:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>We collect only the minimum necessary personal data</li>
        <li>We limit sharing to what is legally or operationally necessary</li>
        <li>We provide clear options regarding data use</li>
        <li>We protect your data with appropriate security measures</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      This Privacy Notice describes the policies applied to the personal information collected through the
      platform website, or when the platform communicates with its users ("you" or "user"), and the
      choices available to you. "Personal Information" means any data that relates to an identified or
      identifiable person, under Article 4(1) GDPR.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform offers a search and discovery feature that allows users to browse scientific services and
      digital resources, such as publications, datasets, software, tools, and training materials. Users are
      provided with a personalised search interface, including filters and categories tailored to improve
      relevance and user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform also enables organisations and service providers to register and onboard their resources,
      making them discoverable and accessible to end users through the catalogue.
    </p>

    <h5>1. Your consent</h5>
    <p>
      By using the platform, you acknowledge this Privacy Notice. Where required by law (e.g., for
      analytics cookies or profiling), we will request your explicit consent before processing begins.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Scope</h5>

      This Privacy Notice applies solely to personal information that is collected and processed through the
      EOSC.pl platform or through any electronic communications initiated via the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not apply to third-party websites, services, or tools that may be linked from or integrated into
      the platform. The platform does not endorse, nor is it responsible for the content, terms, or privacy
      practices of these third-party websites.

    </p>

    <h5>3. Personal data we collect</h5>

    <p><strong>Legal basis for processing:</strong></p>
    <p>We process personal data under the following legal bases, as defined in Article 6 of the GDPR:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b))</strong>, for providing access to platform features and services</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations (Art. 6(1)(c))</strong>, particularly for EU-funded project reporting</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f))</strong>, for platform security, usage analytics, and user experience improvements</li>
      <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))</strong>, where required for specific optional processing (e.g., cookies, newsletter)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The data we collect</strong></p>
    <p>
      The EOSC.pl Platform manages different types of personal data, all in compliance with applicable
      European data protection laws. Personal data concerning the user is collected and processed to
      enable the delivery of services and functionalities offered via the platform. This includes features
      aimed at:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>enabling users to browse and access scientific services and resources, and</li>
      <li>allowing provider organisations to register and onboard services into the platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The data is collected for the following purposes: service access, user profile management, analytics,
      support communication, tag and metadata management, displaying external content, and system security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on your interaction with the platform (either as a user or a service provider), the
      following types of personal data may be collected and processed by the platform, either directly or
      via third-party integrations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cookies and usage data</li>
      <li>First name, last name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Affiliation/organisation name</li>
      <li>Country of origin</li>
      <li>Federated login attributes, such as your name, email address, organisation affiliation, and a unique user ID used for account recognition</li>
      <li>User typology (e.g. researcher, citizen, provider, educator)</li>
      <li>Reason for accessing EOSC services (if submitted voluntarily)</li>
      <li>Information on accessed or ordered services</li>
      <li>Messages and communication with the support team</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Order Management functionality</strong></p>
    <p>For users who interact with the service ordering workflow, additional personal data may be processed, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Details of the service order, such as descriptions, configuration parameters, or project references</li>
      <li>User identifiers and roles within the order flow</li>
      <li>Organisation and project affiliations</li>
      <li>Technical contact details and correspondence related to service requests</li>
      <li>Messages exchanged between users and providers as part of order handling and support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected as part of delivering requested services, tracking progress, and enabling communication between involved parties.</p>

    <p><strong>Data voluntarily supplied by the user</strong></p>
    <p>
      The platform is designed to allow for anonymous browsing in most areas. However, access to
      personalised features (e.g., service ordering or provider registration) requires login and, in some
      cases, completion of a user profile.
    </p>
    <p>In such cases, the following data may be voluntarily submitted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contact details (name, email, institution)</li>
      <li>Service metadata (for providers)</li>
      <li>Descriptions of use cases or projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Providing this data is optional, but necessary to access specific features. Consent may be withdrawn
      at any time, although this may disable the corresponding functionality.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Service and resource metadata</strong></p>
    <p>
      When providers onboard the resources and services, the platform stores and processes service
      descriptions and metadata, structured according to a standardised schema. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic information: resource ID, name, description, provider identity</li>
      <li>Marketing materials: target users, promotional texts, multimedia assets</li>
      <li>Classification: scientific domains, categories</li>
      <li>Geographic and language availability</li>
      <li>Public contact details for user support</li>
      <li>Maturity levels (e.g., TRL, release version, lifecycle phase)</li>
      <li>Relations to other resources within EOSC</li>
      <li>Project and funding references</li>
      <li>Operational information: terms of use, helpdesk links, support SLA</li>
      <li>Access, ordering, and usage constraints</li>
      <li>Financial model or pricing details (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This metadata is published to the platform's catalogue and may be publicly accessible, except for
      specific operational fields reserved for internal management.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Platform usage analytics</strong></p>
    <p>The platform collects aggregated data on how users interact with services and resources. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Anonymised or pseudonymised usage events (e.g., page views, searches, downloads)</li>
      <li>Search terms and selected filters</li>
      <li>Browsing history across sessions (if logged in)</li>
      <li>Resource engagement statistics (e.g., views, clicks, interactions)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide personalised recommendations (where applicable)</li>
      <li>Generate aggregated statistics for platform improvement</li>
      <li>Improve resource discoverability</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No sensitive data or behavioural profiling is performed beyond what is required to improve relevance
      and user experience. Users may object to this processing.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Cookies and tracking technologies</strong></p>
    <p>Cookies and similar tracking technologies are used for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Session management and login authentication</li>
      <li>Remembering user preferences</li>
      <li>Usage analytics</li>
      <li>Displaying content from embedded third-party platforms (e.g., video, charts)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use cookies and third-party tools to support core features and improve your experience. Where
      required by law, we ask for your consent.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Data retention</strong></p>
    <p>
      We retain personal data only as long as needed for platform operation, or as required by legal
      obligations or project agreements (e.g., retention for 3 years after project completion). The User can
      always request that the Data Controller suspend or remove the data.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Third-party data</strong></p>
    <p>
      Users are responsible for any third-party personal data that they provide (e.g., in uploaded service
      descriptions or messages) and confirm that they have the right to do so. The platform assumes that
      such data has been shared lawfully.
